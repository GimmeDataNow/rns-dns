# Dns server


message_to_sign = hash("weather.node" + destination + timestamp)
signature = sign_with_private_key(message_to_sign)

This dns system is made for systems with extremely long ttl entries since the destinations are unique.

respond with error codes

0x00	✅ Success (name found)
0x01	❌ NXDOMAIN (name not found)
0x02	🔒 Not authorized (unauthorized update)
0x03	🕒 Expired (record known, but expired)
0x04	🧾 Invalid signature
0x05	🚫 Verification required (name exists but not trusted)
0x06	🧍 Identity mismatch (wrong owner tried to update) // unlikely error. might reduce the index
0x07	🧱 System error or overload

# entering into a record
1. check if the name/suffix is available and is not reserved
2. provide the public key form which the destination is computed


# verifying a record
1. enter the dns record
2. request a verification from an authority
3. obtain the verification
4. maintain and update the verification


improvements:

eTDL with "use publicsuffix::List;"

since the entries are long lived it might be useful to track:
previous values in a seperate (slower) database
who made the last update
a reason for updating (probably in a seperate database)

add support for a single domain name pointing to multiple destinations
